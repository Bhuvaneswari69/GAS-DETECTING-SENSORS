# GAS DETECTING SENSORS
This project involves building a gas detection system using an MQ-series sensor (e.g., MQ-2, MQ-5, or MQ-135) with Arduino. The system is designed to detect harmful gases such as LPG, methane, carbon monoxide, and smoke in the environment and provide alerts using a buzzer or LED indicator. Optionally, the sensor data can also be displayed on an LCD screen or sent to a cloud dashboard for monitoring.
