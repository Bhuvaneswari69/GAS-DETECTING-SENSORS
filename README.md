# GAS DETECTING SENSORS
This project involves building a gas detection system using an MQ-series sensor (e.g., MQ-2, MQ-5, or MQ-135) with Arduino. The system is designed to detect harmful gases such as LPG, methane, carbon monoxide, and smoke in the environment and provide alerts using a buzzer or LED indicator. Optionally, the sensor data can also be displayed on an LCD screen or sent to a cloud dashboard for monitoring.

## üîç Objective
To monitor air quality in real-time and alert when dangerous gas levels are detected using a sensor and microcontroller.

## üß∞ Components Used
- MQ-2 or MQ-135 Gas Sensor
- Arduino Uno/Nano
- Buzzer (for alarm)
- LEDs (optional)
- Resistors, Breadboard, Jumper Wires

## üõ† Working Principle
The MQ sensor detects gas concentration and outputs an analog value. The Arduino reads this value and compares it to a set threshold to trigger alerts.
